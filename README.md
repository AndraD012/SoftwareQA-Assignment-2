# SoftwareQA-Assignment-2

Description: 

Objective

Apply test-driven development (TDD) to implement a set of software requirements. Write unit
tests to provide adequate coverage of a code-base using your chosen unit testing framework and
test runner.

Scenario

You are to create an application that allows the user to select and run each function and receive
a correct response from the program. The new development manager requires that you code the
application using a test-driven development approach. We define a unit as a function or method
in a class with a single responsibility. The project should be developed and maintained using a
GitHub repository.

Requirements

Command Line Interface - Develop a command line app that prompts the user to enter the input
(although a GUI is not required, you can create one if you want). For now, the app must have
the following functionality.
